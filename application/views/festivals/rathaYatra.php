                            <p  style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">There are several stories associated with RathaYatra. Once in Dwarika, Lord Krishna's eight queens requested mother Rohini to narrate the divine episodes of Lord Krishna with the Gopi’s while he was in Vraj. For a while Rohini dithered. Finally, after a lot of insistence she relented. However, considering it unbecoming of Subhadra to hear such episodes (Leela), she sent her to guard the palace doorway. Yet the Vrajkatha soon absorbed Subhadra. Soon, Lord Shri Krishna and Balaram arrived at the doorway. With arms wide apart, she stood between the two, preventing them from entering. However, from where they stood, Rohini's katha soon engrossed them all! Just then sage Narad arrived. Seeing the siblings standing together like murtis, he humbly prayed, "May the three of you grant darshan in this manner forever." The Lord granted the boon. And the three eternally reside in the Jagannath Mandir in Puri.<br><br>

                            Another story is - When Shri Krishna was being cremated in Dwarika, Balaram, overpowered with grief, dashed into the ocean with Shri Krishna's partially cremated body. Subhadra too, followed both the brothers. At the same time, on the eastern shore of India, King Indradyumna of Jagannath Puri had a dream that the Lord's body would float up to the shores of Puri. He should build a huge mandir in the city and consecrate the wooden murtis of Shri Krishna, Balaram and Subhadra. The bones(asthi) of Lord Krishna's body should be placed in the hollow in the back of the murti. The dream came true. He found the splinters of bone (asthi) and took them <br><br>

                            But the question was who would carve the murtis. It is said that the architect of the gods - Vishwakarma - arrived as an old carpenter. He stipulated that while carving the murtis nobody should disturb him and if anybody did, he would stop work and leave. <br><br>

                            A few months elapsed. Driven with impatience, Indradyumna opened the door of Vishwakarma's room, who vanished instantly as he had stipulated. Despite the incomplete murtis, the king consecrated them, placing the holy cinders of Lord Krishna in the hollow of the murti and installed them in the mandir.

                           <p  style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">  Every year a grand procession is carried out with the murtis of Lord Krishna, Balaram and Subhadra in three gigantic carts. Probably the mandir in Jagannath Puri is the only mandir in the world housing murtis of three deities who are siblings - Lord Krishna, Balaram and Subhadra.</p><br>

                    <p  style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;"><p  style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;"> Traditionally Only Hindu’s are allowed to go inside the temple and have darshan of the Lord. Hence,SrilaPrabhupada started Ratha Yatra in ISKCON all over the world so that everyone can receive blessings of Lord Jagannath, Baladev and Subhadra. The first Ratha yatra outside India was initiated by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (founder of ISKCON) on July 9, 1967 in San Francisco. The Lord of the Universe (Lord Jagannath) now parade in major cities all over the world such as London, Paris, New York, Durban, Rome, etc. People around the globe join the joyful and colourfulRatha yatra festival. Thousands throng the streets to pull the giant chariots, chant and dance and enjoy tasty prasad given to all joining in a celebration to honour the appearance of Lord Jagannath, Baladev and Subhadra.<br><br>


                     The Ratha yatra festival has been traditionally celebrated annually in Jagannath Puri, Orrisa, where Lord Jagannath along with His sister Subhadra and elder brother Baladeva paraded through the streets of the city. This practice and festival continue to take place in Puri and since, late sixties all over the world. The pulling of Rath cart during the Rath yatra procession by the devotees symbolizes the attempt of the residents of Vrindavan, especially the cowherd boys and girls, to bring Krishna, Balarama and Subhadra back to Vrindavan.<br><br>
                            
                    rathe ca vamanamdrstvapunarjanmanavidyate: Simply by seeing the Lord on the chariot, one makes advancement for stopping the repetition of birth and death. To give this opportunity to everyone in the locality, we celebrate the Ratha Yatra of Sri Sri Krishna Balarama every year in the month of January. The utsavadeities of Krishna and Balarama ride on their chariots to bless everyone. The chariot is decorated with a colourful display of lights and flowers. The decorative light fittings are a sight to behold. Thousands of devotees pull the chariot, offer their prayers, join thekirtana of soulful singing and distribute prasad, all along the route of the Ratha Yatra.
