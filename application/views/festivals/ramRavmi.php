                            <p  style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">OShrila Prabhupad and our previous acharyas have mentioned three Purushottams(best amongst the men), namely Lord Ram, who is Maryada Purushottam, Lord Krishna, who is Lila Purushottam, and Lord Gauranga, who is Prem Purushottam. In Gaurnaga lila, after Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya realized the true identity of Mahaprabhu as the supreme personality of godhead Brajendranandan Krishna himself, lord Gaurahari then mercifully revealed to him his Shadbhuj roop(six armed form), with two hands holding a stick and kamandalu, two hands holding a flute and two hands holding a bow and arrow, thus showing the importance of the three Purushottams. Lord Ram being the Maryada Purushottam, played the role of an ordinary human being and displayed through his own pristine character and conduct, how one should follow dharma and lead a life of righteousness.

                            In ISKCON Vrindavan Ram Navami is not only celebrated as the divine appearance day of Lord Ram but also as the auspicious day on which our Spiritual Master and ever well-wisher Srila Prabhupad established the worship of their lordships, Shri Shri Gaur Nitai, Shri Shri Krishna Balaram and Shri Shri Radha Shyamsundar and Lilita Vishakha, for the benefit all his devotees, so that we may serve them in devotion and make spiritual progress on our path back home to the transcendental realm of Golok Vrindavan. This occasion of the installation of the deities is known as Brahmotsav and is of equal import as Janamashtami, Radhashtami and other appearance days of the Lords, indeed it is a combination of all this festivals, for it was on this day that the Lords themselves manifested in the form of the deities.   <br><br>


                            The celebrations of this festival start the evening before Ramnavami with a Shobha Yatra in which the Lords are taken on a procession throughout the temple compound, going to the various prominent places on the premises and giving darshan to the onlooking devotees, who feed their bumble bee like eyes on the divine strikingly beautiful forms of the lotus like lords mounted on their palanquins, decorated with flowers of variegated colors, in regal splendor and carried by their loving devotees,
